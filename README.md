# Object-Detection

# First loaded the training and testing CSV files into Pandas dataframes. Then divided the training data
# into training and validation sets with an 80% to 20% ratio.

# Tested and compared the SVM vs Random forest models.

# The 2nd part involved the street detection model using YOLOv5.
